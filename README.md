When committing code:

1. Stick to Existing Names: Maintain consistency with naming conventions (e.g., ConnectFour_V...).
2. Align Folder and Project Names: Ensure both folder and project share the same name to avoid confusion.
3. Simplify Folder Structure: Keep the code directly inside the folder without extra folders.
4. Selective Committing: Include only modified code, avoiding unrelated files or ZIP archives.
5. Comment Your Commits: Provide descriptive comments for each commit to clarify the purpose of modifications.
