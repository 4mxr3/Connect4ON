When committing code, please adhere to the following steps to prevent code overlap and ensure smooth updates:

1. Stick to Existing Names: Maintain consistency by following the naming conventions already in place. (Ex. ConnectFour_V...) 
2. Selective Committing: Only include the code you've modified, avoiding the addition of unrelated files or ZIP archives.
3. Comment Your Commits: Leave a comment detailing the changes made with each commit, so we know the purpose of the modifications.
4. Align Folder and Project Names: Make sure that both the folder and the project within it share the same name. (Ex. The folder would be called ConnectFour_V5 but when you open it the Program name is ConnectFour_V4 and that is confusing).
5. Simplify Folder Structure: For instance, for "connectfour_v4," the code should directly reside within it, without unnecessary nested folders. (Ex. connectfour_v4 > connectfour_v4 > code)
